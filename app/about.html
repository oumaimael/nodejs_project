            <div class="mission-statement">
                <p>At Cats Gallery, we are more than just a website showcasing adorable cats. We are a volunteer-driven organization dedicated to rescuing cats without homes and helping those whose owners can no longer care for them, finding each feline a loving forever home.</p>

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Founded in 2023, Cats Gallery began as a small group of cat lovers who noticed the growing number of cats in our community without homes. What started as a simple effort to help a few local cats has grown into a comprehensive adoption platform connecting hundreds of cats with caring families.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Volunteer Work</h3>
            <p>Our dedicated team of volunteers works tirelessly to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rescue stray and abandoned cats from the streets</li>
                <li>Provide temporary foster care for cats in transition</li>
                <li>Assist families who can no longer care for their cats due to various circumstances</li>
                <li>Screen potential adopters to ensure safe, loving environments</li>
                <li>Provide medical care and rehabilitation for cats in need</li>
                <li>Educate the community about responsible pet ownership</li>
